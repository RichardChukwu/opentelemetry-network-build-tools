 # Contributing to OpenTelemetry-eBPF Build Tools

## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry-eBPF Build Tools repository! ðŸŽ‰
This repository contains third-party tools and libraries needed to build projects in the `opentelemetry-ebpf` repository.

Building this repository results in a build environment container image that is then used for building artifacts of the main project (see the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-network/blob/main/docs/developing.md)).

We value all contributions, whether big or small, and encourage you to join us in improving this project. If you have questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the OpenTelemetry communityâ€”weâ€™re here to help!
